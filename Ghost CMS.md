[structure of a ghost theme](https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/handlebars-themes/structure/)

#### Bare minimum of a Ghost theme:
A folder with `index.hbs`, `post.hbs` and `package.json`. This will bring up loads of warnings if you activate it in your admin view but it will work. Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqHw0we2WP4&list=PLtKjv92L0ihBBXGz7iCdtTkvdD0dXXy78&index=7 

##### Ghost helpers
This is where the magic lies! ü§ì üòá

#### Core elements
Ghost (and subsequently Ghost themes) have a few core concepts from which they build their structure. Most of these are standard elements of any blogging engine or platform.

**Posts**: Referred to as ‚ÄúStories‚Äù within user admin, posts are the base unit of Ghost. They‚Äôre blog posts‚Ä¶ like the one you‚Äôre reading‚Ä¶ right now.
Pages: Pages are actually a sub-variant of posts. They have all the same properties as posts, but are excluded from the list/index of posts and won‚Äôt appear on the homepage.
**Authors**: Authors are discrete objects that are associated posts and pages. The authors in a blog will also have their own pages including their avatar, description, and the post they‚Äôve written.
**Navigation**: Navigation is user customizable via the Ghost admin. You‚Äôre able to design a template within your theme for how the navigation manifests on each page.
**Tags**: Tags can be associated with either posts or pages. Like authors, tags get their own page with all the posts that have the relevant tag, as well as an optional image and description. When tagging a post, the first tag in the series considered the ‚Äúprimary tag,‚Äù and can be given special features or privileges within the theme.
**Blog Attributes**: The blog themselves can also have various attributes that are customized via the admin. This includes blog title, blog description, logos, and social icons.
**Email Signup**: The enabling of email sign-up within the admin is currently optional and is by default deactivated. However, you can definitely add support for it within your theme. There‚Äôre two items associated with email subscription. First is a partial, that can be included anywhere throughout your site, which will generate a standard e-mail signup form. The second is a discrete email subscription page which is also customizable, comes pre-baked with a standard look and feel similar to that of the login page.
You also have the ability to customize the login pages for Ghost, but doing so is typically unneeded for the majority of projects.

#### How to modify a theme

#### Current Folder
"Don‚Äôt worry about the current folder, that‚Äôs your installation of ghost; you don‚Äôt want to touch that."
"...of course ‚Äì naturally current should be (and is) a symlink to the currently active version‚Äôs folder."

#### Version Folder
"The version-level content folder is mainly used for developing Ghost, but also contains the latest release of casper."


#### Version Control and pair development

"First I would say separate the production instance‚Ä¶
for developing theme setup a Development instance ghost install local

On dev instance use github only for the theme folder content/themes/casper

Deploy the theme to production with github action https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-ghost-theme "

### Update Ghost
The command `ghost update` will coach you through the update.
"If you installed Ghost using Ghost-CLI, the ghost update command will inform you of the commands to run to perform the necessary intermediate updates."
