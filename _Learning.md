there is an art to it

# extracted gold:
- make as many connections to stuff already learned as possible. New knowledge is like a plant: the more roots it sprouts the likelier it is you'll find it next time around.

- be active about it. Everything active about it helps with connecting and memorizing it. Write, explain, make mindmaps, sketches, vizualize it, be creative with it in ANY way. (I transfer many new things into a fantasy world.)

# When I'm stuck
- zoom in and out - go really close into it, take you time to see the details, read the error message word for word OR zoom out and remind yourself about the big picture: where are you, what are you trying to achieve, what is the next step?
- take a break
- visualize it
- verbalize it - talk to yourself or a colleague about what you are doing, write it down if necessary - than you can also put it on stackoverflow, etc
- reflect about your expectations
- back to the Kanban board, break down the ticket into smaller steps
- write pseudo code
- be conscious about your emotional level - you might need to take a break or do something else that will give you a success
- when you get unstuck: reflect on how and why you got stock
