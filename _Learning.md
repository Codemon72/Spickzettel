there is an art to it

# extracted gold:
- make as many connections to stuff already learned as possible. New knowledge is like a plant: the more roots it sprouts the likelier it is you'll find it next time around.

- be active about it. Everything active about it helps with connecting and memorizing it. Write, explain, make mindmaps, sketches, vizualize it, be creative with it in ANY way. (I transfer many new things into a fantasy world.)
