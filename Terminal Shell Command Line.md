## Fledgling Section / For Beginners

- whenever you see instructions what to write in your CLI (Command Line Interface) they start with an `$`. The ‚Äú$‚Äù in the code just symbolizes the command prompt. It‚Äôs not actually part of the command you run.



## Examples / SimonSays

`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql/*` 
- execute as sudo
    - remove files or directories
        - -r, -R, --recursive
       remove directories and their contents recursively
          - -f, --force
          ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

---

`ls -l /tmp/mysql.sock` 
- list directory contents  
    - use a long listing format
      - List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.
