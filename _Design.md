#### Website Concept
1. find your 3 prime messages you want to convey
2. make sketches of you 


#### Color Scheme
Kevin: "One is three already."

1. start with black and white and make it work
2. add **1** other color
2.1. this can be an obvious color (like brown for a coffee website) or an opposite (e.g. brown - turquoise)
**Tipp**: if you have a beautiful image or logo, try picking a color out of it
3. *if* you wish to pick more than one color, consider choosing a variation of your first color.
**Tipp**: go to https://mycolor.space/ and scroll down to 'shades'
4. if you **really** want to bring in a second color, use a complementary one (to your first color).
**Tipp**: if it doesn't work, never be afraid to change it up a bit. E.g. in the dev tools color picker or just with opacity.
