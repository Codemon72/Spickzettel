- google - if you like the company or not: for finding programming related stuff it is most often the best. And therefore henceforth I'll use the word 'googling' instead of 'search via your favorite search engine'.
For getting the basic concepts:
- google with "eli5". Meaning "explain it like I'm 5".
- google with "TIL". Meaning: "today I learned".
- google with "visualization"
- google with "meaning"
- google in order:
  1. name of the language you are using
  2. other words

Tips from Paul:
- google: "github awesome javascript tutorial" (or book, blog, article)
- search the term on youtube. Explained by a person, maybe even with imagery is often helpful.

- take your time with the official docs or README files. They are frequently tricky to get into but *can* be quite enlightening.

#### when lost
The French build a road across the Sahara. Because of sand and wind the road can become  covered with sand and totally invisible. So they put up black oil drums at every 5 km (which is how far you can spot anything due to the curvature of the earth). 
So when lost, look for one oil barrel. When you find it you will be able to see the next.
