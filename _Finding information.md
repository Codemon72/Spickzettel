- google - if you like the company or not: for finding programming related stuff it is most often the best. And therefore henceforth I'll use the word 'googling' instead of 'search via your favorite search engine'.
- google with "eli5". Meaning "explain it like I'm 5".
- google with "visualization"
- google with "meaning"
- search the term on youtube. Explained by a person, maybe even with imagery is often helpful.
- take your time with the official docs or README files. They are frequently tricky to get into but *can* be quite enlightening.
