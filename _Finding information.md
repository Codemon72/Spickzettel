### Using Google
- google - if you like the company or not: for finding programming related stuff it is most often the best. And therefore henceforth I'll use the word 'googling' instead of 'search via your favorite search engine'.
For getting the basic concepts of a subject:
- add "**eli5**". Meaning "explain it like I'm 5".
- add "**TIL**". Meaning: "today I learned".
- add "**visualization**", "**meaning**", "**basics**", "**cheat sheet**"
- often the best approach is to ask in a very simple way like "how to build a shopify app" (instead of "shopify app developer requirements")
- words in order:
  1. name of the language you are using
  2. other words
- "text in **quotes**" for an exact match
- `AND` operator will return only results related to both terms: `html AND css`
- You can use the `OR` operator to get the results related to one of the search terms: `(javascript OR python) free course`
- `-` operator will exclude results that contain a term or phrase: `javascript -css`
- You can use the `*` **wildcards** as placeholders, which will be replaced by any word or phrase: `"how to start * in 6 months"`
- `site:...` Search inside a **single website**: `site:freecodecamp.org`
- `filetype:...` You can also use a very useful feature that helps to find a **specific file type**: `filetype:pdf learn css`
- `...` Search for a **range of numbers**: `ecmascript 2016..2018`
- Use the `before` operator to return only results before a given date
You must provide year-month-day dates or only a year. For example: `javascript before:2020`
- Use the `after` operator to return only results after a given date
You must provide year-month-day dates or only a year. For example: `web development after:2020`

Tips from Paul:
- google: "github awesome javascript tutorial" (or book, blog, article)
- search the term on youtube. Explained by a person, maybe even with imagery is often helpful.

- take your time with the official docs or README files. They are frequently tricky to get into but *can* be quite enlightening.

#### when lost
The French build a road across the Sahara. Because of sand and wind the road can become  covered with sand and totally invisible. So they put up black oil drums at every 5 km (which is how far you can spot anything due to the curvature of the earth). 
So when lost, look for one oil barrel. When you find it you will be able to see the next.
