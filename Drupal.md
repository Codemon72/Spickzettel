## Overview of Drupal
Drupal is an open-source dynamic content management system (CMS) that allows users to create, manage, and customize websites and web applications. It's known for its flexibility, scalability, and robustness, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from simple blogs to complex enterprise websites. Drupal is highly modular, meaning users can extend its functionality through modules, and it has a large and active community providing support, resources, and updates.
