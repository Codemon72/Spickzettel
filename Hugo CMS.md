# Hugo CMS


#### Hugo operators
`eq` = equals
`ne`= not equal
`gt` = greater than
`lt` = less than
`ge`= greater or equal than
`le`= less or equal than

Unlike most other logic languages, here we put the comparison operator before the two arguments:
```
{{ if ne .Section "blog" }}current{{ end }}
```
