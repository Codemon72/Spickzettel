Structured Query Language

SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one:
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**
  - used to query the database for information
  - get information that is already stored there
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
  - used for defining database schemas
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**
  - used for controlling access to the data in the database
  - user & permission management
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
  - used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database.

  #### Queries
  - A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
    - goal is to only get the data you need
    - out of TONS of data in a DB
    - often hidden in a complex schema
